# Library trees
 This is a library of all dendriform data structures, such as red black tree, avl trees, b+ trees and so on.<br>
 All of dendriform data structures in the library has no allocater.<br>
 So, you must provide memory space by yourself/yourselves to use the dendriform data structures.<br>
 The library is written by C++, C users can't use the library.<br>
 However, if you want to use the library by C, you can make C interfaces by yourself.<br>
